# Welcome to ArduLED 2.0

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, THIS MEANS THAT IT IS NOT NEARLY AS FUNCTIONAL AS ARDULED 1.0**

Welcome to ArduLED 2.0! This is an updated version of ArduLED 1.0, with more features and more modern look than the 1.0 version. The biggest addition is the ability to use an ESP8266 now, as well as running multiple devices at the same time.

Currently in development, so this readme will be updated later.
